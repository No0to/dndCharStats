# dndChatStats

This is my first program in a while, and the main reason why is loss of inspiration.

Well anyway, the way it works is that you run the program, and it writes DND character stats. It also saves a file with your current character stats to the directory the file is in! Sadly due to part laziness, there can only be one file with your character history.
